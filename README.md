StickyShots

Float any image as a draggable sticky note on top of any app, anywhere on your screen.

Right-click any image on the web → it appears as a floating, draggable, resizable sticky note that hovers above every application on your desktop. Perfect for reference images, inspiration boards, or quick visual lookups.

No cloud. No accounts. Everything stays on your machine.

Features

- Drag any image from the web — right-click → "Send to StickyShots"
- Floats above everything — even fullscreen games and apps
- Auto-fits to image size — no awkward cropping or padding
- Sleek, minimal UI — inspired by Spotify's picture-in-picture
- Session-based library — images live in memory, download what you want to keep
- Completely private — all data stays local, no syncing, no tracking
- Intuitive controls — drag, resize, lock position, duplicate, download

Installation

Option 1: Download Pre-Built (Recommended for most users)

1. Download the latest release:
   - Windows (1-Click Installer): [stickyshots_release.exe](https://github.com/aadidoesitbetter/stickyshots/releases/download/v1.0.0-dev/stickyshots_release.exe)
   - Developers (Source Zip): [stickyshots_dev_release.zip](https://github.com/aadidoesitbetter/stickyshots/releases/download/v1.0.0-dev/stickyshots_dev_release.zip)

2. Install the Chrome extension:
   - Open chrome://extensions
   - Enable Developer mode (top right)
   - Click Load unpacked
   - Select the chrome-extension/ folder from the release

3. Run the desktop app and keep it running in your system tray
4. Right-click any image and select "Send to StickyShots"

Option 2: Build from Source (For developers)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/aadidoesitbetter/stickyshots.git
cd stickyshots

# Install dependencies
cd app
npm install

# Run locally
npm start

# Or build an installer for your OS
npm run dist        # current platform
npm run dist:mac    # macOS .dmg
npm run dist:win    # Windows .exe  
npm run dist:linux  # Linux .AppImage
```

How It Works

1. Desktop app (Electron) — runs in your system tray, listens on http://127.0.0.1:8743 by default
2. Chrome extension — adds a right-click menu on images, sends them to the local app
3. Sticky notes — frameless, transparent, always-on-top windows render each image
4. Library — right-click tray icon → "Open Library" to see all images, re-pin, or download

Port conflict? The app auto-detects if port 8743 is busy and tries 8744–8800. The extension automatically finds the right port.

Usage

On the Desktop App

- Drag — click and hold anywhere on the note (slight tilt animation)
- Resize — drag the bottom-right corner
- Lock — pins the note in place (hover to see controls)
- Duplicate — creates a copy
- Download — save the image to disk
- Close — removes the note (image stays in library until you close the app)
- Library — right-click tray icon → "Open Library" to see all images, re-pin, or download
- Check for Updates — (currently in progress, coming in the next version)

From the Browser

1. Find any image online
2. Right-click it → "Send to StickyShots"
3. Check the extension popup to confirm the desktop app is running
4. Image appears as a floating note on your screen

Privacy

- All images stay on your machine — zero network requests after receiving the image
- Session-based — close the app and everything clears from memory
- No tracking — no analytics, no telemetry, no accounts
- Open source — audit the code yourself

Troubleshooting

"StickyShots app is not running"
- Make sure the desktop app is open (check your system tray / menu bar)
- Restart the app if needed

Image won't send from a website
- Some sites block cross-origin image fetches. The app tries three strategies:
  1. Fetch via the page's context (works for ~95% of cases)
  2. Direct fetch (works for CORS-permissive sites)
  3. Server-side fetch (ultimate fallback, works even with hotlink protection)
- If all fail, the site is aggressively blocking downloads

Port conflict error
- The app needs ports 8743–8800 available. Close other apps using these ports and restart.

Extension not loading
- Go to chrome://extensions and ensure Developer mode is on
- Click Reload on the StickyShots card if you updated the extension
